# Oakland: Assumptions and limitations

- We do not have data on the height/bulk/intensity districts, so some zones have wide ranges of what may be permitted in different height/bulk/intensity districts
  - CN zones in the 35* height district take on the density of nearest RH, RD or RM zone. This is not reflected in the data (not even in the ranges).
