# San Diego: Assumptions and limitations

- No overlays, not specified in zoning file. Some planned districts include their own codes, which are included. Those that modify existing codes are not included.
- Maximum FARs in Centre City Planned District do not follow zone designations and this it is not possible to include them.
- The Mid-City Communities Zone has been repealed but is still present in the source data. The area is small.
- Transit overlay and Parking Impact Overlay zones are not included due to lack of data. They make the parking requirements .25 spaces per unit higher or lower.
- The Mission Valley Community Plan zones in the file bear no resemblance to those in the municipal code.
