# San Jos√©: Assumptions and limitations

- Planned Developments have density reported by the city, and use codes that we guessed at - we can generally determine if a project permits residential or not, but can't really determine if it's multifamily or only single family. It should be noted that PDs are kind of like nonconforming uses; they can't easily be built again when they wear out. For some analyses it may make sense to drop them.
- Height limits from specific plans and urban villages are not included due to data availability concerns.
