# Sacramento: Assumptions and limitations

- Some overlay zones are not documented and therefore not overlaid (e.g. R)
- Floor area ratios are referenced as being defined in the general plan, but I can't find where
- In the Urban and Traditional parking districts, small lots in the center city [are exempt from parking requirements](http://www.qcode.us/codes/sacramento/view.php?topic=17-vi-17_608-17_608_030&frames=on); this is not reflected in the data.
