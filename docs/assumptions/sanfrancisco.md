# San Francisco :bridge_at_night:: Assumptions and limitations

- TRANSIT CENTER C-3-O(SD) COMMERCIAL SPECIAL USE DISTRICT restricts the amount of residential allowed in mixed-use buildings, this is not represented in the model
- Special use districts smaller than 0.25 square kilometers are not represented, and the areas within them are shown as if there were no special use district
- Neighborhood Commercial districts (except for Excelsior, Japantown, and all Neighborhood Commercial Transit districts) have a density limit specified but also the note that if the nearest R zone has a higher density zoning, that it should prevail. This is not represented in the output.
